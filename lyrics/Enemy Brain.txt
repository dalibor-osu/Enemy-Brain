Just another day in this hell world, hey#11353
I don't let it in, I get by okay#14144
Step through the fog, how am I feelin' today#16934
Well you know#19725
You know, you know#20423
You know, know#21469
See I was doing great 'til the happiness tax#22516
Round 4pm it just hits like that#25132
Yeah, some of my best days still go bad#27923
But you know, you know#30888
You know, you know#32109
I been tryna figure it out#33155
Oh, there's gotta be some kinda reason why#36120
I've been feeling so down#38911
I did everything right#41702
But it still feels like the#43097
Sky's falling down#44841
It's my enemy brain, ain't cooperating#47283
It's beating me down#50248
And it's freaking me out#52865#56178

(Enemy brain, enеmy brain)
(It's always the same, always the samе)
(Enemy brain, enemy brain)
(Yeah)

OKAY OKAY OKAY
I can't quite tell if it's cool or depraved
Having pizza for breakfast for the last 5 days
How am I gonna shake this bad vibe haze
Well I don't know, don't know, don't know, don't know, no

If I fall down and don't know how
How am I meant to pick myself up right now
Seems like maybe I should know by now
But you know, you know, you know, you know

I been tryna figure it out
Oh, there's gotta be some kinda reason why I've been feeling so down
I did everything right but it still feels like the sky's falling down
It's my enemy brain, ain't cooperating
It's beating me down
And it's freaking me out
Yeah, yeah
